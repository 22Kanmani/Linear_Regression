# Linear_Regression

Linear regression - To predict the relationship between two variables, we'll use a simple linear regression model.

In a simple linear regression model, weâ€™ll predict the outcome of a variable known as the dependent variable using only one independent variable.

make sure to follow these five steps to build a linear regression model:
1) Reading and understanding the data
2) Visualizing the data
3) Performing simple linear regression
4) Residual analysis
5) Predictions on the test set
